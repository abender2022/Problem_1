# Data Preparation and Visualization
###### We began by importing the necessary libraries and modules, including NumPy for numerical computations, Matplotlib for plotting, and Torch for deep learning. We also installed and imported the wandb library for experiment tracking.

```
%%capture
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import torch
from torchvision import datasets
!pip install wandb
import wandb as wb
from skimage.io import imread
```
